You are an expert building energy modeling engineer. Generate a complete EnergyPlus IDF file based on the following building description:

BUILDING DESCRIPTION:
{building_description}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a complete, valid EnergyPlus IDF file, version 24.1
2. Include only the following objects: version, simulation control, building, time step, run period, shedule type limits, schedule compact, schedule constant, material, windowmaterial, construction, geometry rules, zone, building surface details, fenestration surface detail, people, lights, electric equipment, zone infiltration design flow rate
3. Use standard EnergyPlus object names and syntax 
4. if the building has more than 3 floors, create only bottom floor, mid floor, top floor. use the multiplier field in the zone object to indicate repeated floors.
5. Use reasonable default values for missing specifications
6. create perimeter zones and core zone.
7. The outer envelope must be fully enclosed. Each zone must be fully enclosed with surfaces.
8. all internal walls have surface boundary condition.
9. for people, lights and equipment use only schedules provided on the idf_example.
10. Do not add any HVAC objects.

Please provide ONLY the IDF file content, starting with the first object and ending with the last object. Do not include explanation.
